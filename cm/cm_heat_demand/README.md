# References 
This calculation module (CM) was originally written as part of the 
[HotMaps](https://www.hotmaps-project.eu/) project.

The documentation that was done for this first version can be found on
(this section)[https://wiki.hotmaps.eu/en/CM-District-heating-potential-areas-user-defined-thresholds] 
of the project HotMaps wiki.

# Goal of the calculation module
This CM calculates district heating potential within the selected region using 2 threshold values: 
* Minimum heat demand in each hectare, 
* Minimum heat demand in a DH area.
